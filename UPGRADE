This file contains some important notes on upgrade process.

* Upgrading to LizardFS 3.12.x:
    Direct upgrade is possible from LizardFS 2.6.0 - 3.12.x.
    - See upgrade notes for 3.10.0 for a detailed description.

* Upgrading to LizardFS 3.11.x:
    Direct upgrade is possible from LizardFS 2.6.0 - 3.11.x.
    - See upgrade notes for 3.10.0 for a detailed description.

* Upgrading to LizardFS 3.10.x:
    Direct upgrade is possible from LizardFS 2.6.0 - 3.10.x.
    - See upgrade notes for 3.10.0 for a detailed description.

* Upgrading to LizardFS 3.10.0:
    Direct upgrade is possible from LizardFS 2.6.0 - 3.9.4.
    - For upgrade from LizardFS 2.6.0, see upgrade notes for LizardFS 3.9.2
    - Upgrade shadow master servers before the master server; shadow master will always
      refuse to connect to the master server in any newer version.
    - Upgrade the master/shadow servers before any chunkserver or client.
    - Chunkservers should be updated before clients, as they can still understand legacy
      mount requests. Updating a client first will result in being unable to read from/write to
      a 2.6.0 chunkserver.
    - Neither master servers nor chunkservers have hard coded connection limit anymore.
      The previous value were 5000 for master server and 10000 for chunkserver.
      It is advisable to check if system limits are high enough for proper work of LizardFS cluster.
      Mentioned values can be changed by modifying /etc/security/limits.d/10-lizardfs.conf
      file or by using ulimit command.

* Upgrading to LizardFS 3.9.4:
    Direct upgrade is possible from LizardFS 3.9.2 and LizardFS 2.6.0.
    - 3.9.2 chunkservers need to be upgraded ASAP due to protocol changes
    - See upgrade notes for LizardFS 3.9.2

    Direct upgrade is possible from LizardFS 2.6.0.

    - Upgrade shadow master servers before the master server; shadow master will always
      refuse to connect to the master server in any newer version.
      !!!!!!!!!! ATTENTION !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ATTENTION !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ATTENTION !!!!!!!!!!
      ! It is recommended to perform metadata save before upgrading shadow servers       !
      ! and refrain from using mfsmakesnapshot tool before upgrading master.             !
      ! Not complying to this rule might cause potential checksum mismatches in shadows. !
      ! Metadata save can be triggered by admin tool:                                    !
      ! $ lizardfs-admin save-metadata HOST PORT                                         !
