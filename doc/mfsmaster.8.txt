== DESCRIPTION

*mfsmaster* is the metadata server program of Lizard File System. Depending on parameters it can
start, restart or stop LizardFS metadata server process. Without any options it starts LizardFS
metadata server, killing previously run process if lock file exists.

Metadata server can work in one of two modes (personalities):

. master
. shadow

If metadata server works with 'master' personality it acts as main metadata server
govering all file system metadata modifications.
If metadata server works with 'shadow' personality it acts as backup metadata server
ready for immediate deployment as new 'master' in case of current 'master' failure.
Shadow only accepts connections from lizardfs-admin, i.e. mfschunkserver, mfsmetalogger
and mfsmount (the client) are not allowed to connect to 'shadow' instance.

Current metadata server personality is defined in metadata server configuration file
and can be changed on the fly from 'shadow' to 'master' by proper modification and reloading
of its configuration file.

'Master' and 'shadow' are designed to run simultaneously in sync forever. It is very unlikely
but still (due to a memory corruption or a bug) possible that after some time their metadata
will somehow differ. Since version 2.5.2 metadata checksum is maintained both by 'master'
and 'shadow', in order to detect and fix possible metadata corruptions. In case mismatch is
detected 'shadow' asks 'master' to double check its metadata and dump its current snapshot.
After the metadata is dumped and the checksum in 'master' is recalculated shadow downloads
the new metadata snapshot, which should ensure that master and all shadows have exactly the
same metadata.

SIGHUP (or 'reload' 'ACTION') forces *mfsmaster* to reload all configuration files.

*-v*::
print version information and exit

*-h*::
print usage information and exit

*-f*::
(deprecated, use *start* action instead)
forcily run LizardFS master process, without trying to kill
previous instance (this option allows to run LizardFS master if stale PID file exists)

*-s*::
(deprecated, use *stop* action instead)
stop LizardFS master process

*-c* 'CFGFILE'::
specify alternative path of configuration file (default is *mfsmaster.cfg* in system configuration
directory)

*-u*::
log undefined configuration values (when default is assumed)

*-d*::
run in foreground, don't daemonize

*-t* 'LOCKTIMEOUT'::
how long to wait for lockfile (default is 60 seconds)

'ACTION'::
is the one of *start*, *stop*, *restart*, *reload*, *test*, *isalive* or *kill*. Default action is
*restart*.
