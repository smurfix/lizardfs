== DESCRIPTION

*mfschunkserver* is the data server of Lizard File System. Depending on parameters it can start,
restart or stop LizardFS chunkserver process. Without any options it starts LizardFS chunkserver,
killing previously run process if lock file exists.

SIGHUP (or *reload* 'ACTION') forces *mfschunkserver* to reload all configuration files.

Chunkserver periodically tests stored chunks (see *HDD_TEST_FREQ* option
in *mfschunkserver.cfg* manual).

LizardFS master doesn't send metadata change logs to chunkserver and
expect at least one *mfsmetalogger* daemon to connect.

Chunkserver scans attached disks in background.

== OPTIONS

*-v*::
print version information and exit

*-h*::
print usage information and exit

*-f*::
(deprecated, use *start* action instead)
forcily run LizardFS chunkserver process, without trying to kill previous instance (this option
allows to run LizardFS chunkserver if stale PID file exists)

*-s*::
(deprecated, use *stop* action instead)
stop LizardFS chunkserver process

*-c* 'CFGFILE'::

*-t* 'LOCKTIMEOUT'::

*restart*.
