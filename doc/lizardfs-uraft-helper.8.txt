========================

== NAME

lizardfs-uraft-helper - LizardFS HA suite helper

== SYNOPSIS

[verse]
lizardfs-uraft-helper

== DESCRIPTION

*lizardfs-uraft-helper* is a helper script, used internally by *lizardfs-uraft*
to manage nodes. The script should implement the following operations:
  isalive
  metadata-version
  quick-stop
  promote
  demote
  assign-ip
  drop-ip

Except from *isalive*, this script should not be used on its own.
If anyone needs special actions to be taken during *lizardfs-uraft* management
stages (such as promotion, demotion), editing this script is sufficient to do so.
